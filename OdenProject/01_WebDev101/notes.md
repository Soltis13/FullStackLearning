## Web Developers  
    Web developers build and maintain websites.

    The “Front End” is the stuff you see on the website in your browser, including the presentation of content and the user interface elements like the navigation bar. Front End Developers make use of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and their relevant frameworks to ensure that content is presented effectively and that users have an excellent experience.

    The “Back End” refers to the guts of the application, which live on the server. They manipulate data appropriately to make sure the Front End has what it needs. This can become very complicated as things scale. Back End Developers make use of programming languages like Java, Python, and Ruby (among many others) to work with data.
